Prototyping
===========

The example Books used here are the top 25 from the Gutenberg book Project (from the 12.01.2015).

The drop-in folder should remain unchanged - so everyone can work with those examples.

There are some scripts. The start script should be the scandropin.py. The other python scripts are just modules for the main script.
